# NLTNC
This Program is Written in Java.
This program is designed to take phylogenetic tree files (such as .tree and .nwk), take the GCF and GCA accessions out, search them in the NCBI database, find the name and strain designation, and then swap accession ID with the name and strain designation. This allows for the easy renaming of phylogenetic trees, with few errors.

I hope you enjoy and let me know of any issues!
